# Java_StellarCrush
This is a game I made in Java during my second year of my degree in Electrical & Electronic Engineering at Stellenbosch University. I completed this project for the module Computer Science 214. Simply run the main in StellarCrush.java. Features include:

1) Use of hashmaps, implements Maps in GameState, GameObjectLibrary.
2) playerObject extends GameObject, use for polymorphism.
3) The following additions were made:
    - Added Grey Scale in updateObject3D for more realistic camera, where objects are further away from the camera the darkness decreases and becomes grey.
    - Added ball count to show how close you are to completing a level.
    - Added difficulty choice (levels) for increased game difficulty.
    - Added mouse control instead of keys and have more realistic physics when moving the mouse.
    - Made "flames" on the player when it thrusts in one direction.
    - Boundary conditions halves the velocity and changes the direction of the objects.
